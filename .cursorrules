# Four Meme CLI - Project Intelligence

## Code Structure Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix interfaces with 'I' (e.g., ITokenConfig)
- Prefix type aliases with 'T' (e.g., TTokenParams)

### File Organization

- Place interfaces and types in dedicated files
- Group related functionality in modules
- Keep module boundaries clean
- Use index.ts for exporting public APIs
- Organize launch strategies in separate modules

## API Integration Patterns

### Authentication Flow

- Generate nonce first
- Sign nonce with wallet
- Submit signature to login endpoint
- Store and use the returned authentication token in all subsequent requests
- Track token expiry and refresh as needed

### API Call Pattern

- Always include proper headers (content-type, cookies, etc.)
- Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Log API responses for debugging
- Use typed response objects

## Blockchain Integration

### Transaction Handling

- Always estimate gas before sending transactions
- Consider gas price strategies for quick execution
- Monitor transaction receipts for confirmation
- Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
- Use viem instead of ethers.js for all blockchain interactions

### Multiple Wallet Management

- Load private keys from .env
- Never log private keys or expose them in errors
- Use descriptive names for wallet configurations
- Support up to 39 wallets for bundling operations
- Implement a wallet coordinator service for orchestration

## Token Bundling Patterns

### Launch Strategies

- Bundle Launch: Create token and execute all purchases in rapid succession
- Staggered Launch: Create token with immediate dev wallet buy, followed by timed purchases
- Anti-Sniper Launch: Monitor for sniper activity and implement countermeasures

### Transaction Coordination

- Implement precise timing for transaction execution
- Use block-based timing for optimal coordination
- Add configurable delays between transactions
- Monitor transaction confirmations before proceeding to next steps

### Anti-Sniper Techniques

- Detect and track external buyers
- Implement protection measures against front-running
- Use gas price strategies to ensure faster execution than snipers
- Consider on-chain defenses for serious protection

## CLI Preferences

### User Experience

- Use colorful terminal output for better readability
- Show progress spinners for long-running operations
- Provide clear error messages with potential solutions
- Offer verbose mode for debugging
- Add strategy selection interface for different launch patterns

### Image Handling

- Support multiple image formats
- Validate image dimensions before upload
- Compress images as needed
- Provide preview capability when possible

## Testing Strategy

- Unit test core business logic
- Mock API calls in tests
- Use integration tests for key workflows
- Maintain test data separate from production code
- Test different launch strategies with minimal values

## Learned Patterns

### four.meme API

- API requires specific headers for authentication
- Nonce generation is required before login
- Cookies must be maintained between requests
- May need to handle token refreshing

### Token Creation

- Sequence of: auth → image upload → token parameters → contract deployment
- Small delays may be needed between steps
- Need to monitor for contract creation before purchase
- Coordinated timing is essential for bundled launches

### Token Bundling

- Transaction sequencing affects success rate
- Higher gas prices needed for competitive launches
- Wallet count impacts overall performance
- Network congestion can disrupt launch timing
- Different strategies work better in different market conditions
