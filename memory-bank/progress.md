### Current Focus

- Fixing the failing tests
- Preparing for testing with small amounts of real money
- Improving error recovery mechanisms for failed transactions
- Enhancing transaction monitoring and confirmation

### What's Left to Build

1. **Test Fixes**

   - Fix the BundleLaunchStrategy execution test
   - Fix the StaggeredLaunchStrategy execution test
   - Fix the engine error handling test
   - Improve wallet coordinator mocking in tests

2. **Enhanced Features**

   - Advanced transaction monitoring
   - Better error recovery mechanisms
   - Configuration profiles for different scenarios
   - Advanced anti-sniper countermeasures

3. **Robustness Improvements**

   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Transaction retry mechanisms with adaptive gas pricing
   - Network congestion detection
   - Sanity checks for real money transactions

4. **Documentation & Testing**
   - User documentation for different strategies
   - Example configurations
   - Testing with real tokens on mainnet
   - Performance testing with multiple wallets

## Known Issues

- BundleLaunchStrategy execution test failing with "No clients available for confirmation check"
- StaggeredLaunchStrategy execution test failing with the same error
- Engine error handling test failing to propagate strategy execution error
- Need to improve wallet coordinator mocking in tests

## Next Priority

1. Fix the failing tests for strategies and engine error handling
2. Add better wallet coordinator mocking in tests
3. Test with small amounts of real money on mainnet
4. Implement sanity checks for real money transactions
5. Create user documentation for different strategies
