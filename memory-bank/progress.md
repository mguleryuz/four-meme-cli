# Four Meme CLI - Progress

## Project Status: Implementation Phase

### What Works

- Project structure set up with TypeScript
- CLI command framework implemented with Commander
- Authentication flow created using SIWE and ethers.js
- Token creation API integration implemented
- Basic blockchain interaction for token creation and purchasing
- Interactive CLI interface with prompts for missing parameters
- Development mode for testing without real private keys

### Current Tasks in Progress

- Testing the implementation with real credentials
- Improving error handling and retries
- Enhancing contract deployment monitoring

### Completed Tasks

- Set up TypeScript project structure
- Implemented authentication flow
- Created token creation and upload functionality
- Built CLI command structure
- Set up blockchain interaction services
- Implemented multi-wallet purchasing

### What's Left to Build

1. **Enhanced Features**

   - Advanced purchase strategies
   - Configuration file support
   - Logging and debugging tools
   - Token liquidity management

2. **Robustness Improvements**

   - Better error handling
   - API rate limiting management
   - Transaction retry mechanisms
   - Contract deployment confirmation

3. **User Experience**
   - More detailed progress indicators
   - Better error messages
   - Configuration management UI
   - Command for token sniping

## Known Issues

- Contract deployment monitoring needs improvement
- Error handling needs enhancement
- Need better coordination for multi-wallet purchases
- Image processing could be improved

## Next Priority

1. Test with real credentials to verify functionality
2. Implement better error handling and retries
3. Enhance contract deployment monitoring
