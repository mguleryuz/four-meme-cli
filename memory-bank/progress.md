# Four Meme CLI - Progress

## Project Status: Token Bundling Implementation Phase

### What Works

- Project structure set up with TypeScript
- CLI command framework implemented with Commander
- Authentication flow created using SIWE
- Token creation API integration implemented
- Basic blockchain interaction for token creation and purchasing

- Development mode for testing without real private keys

### What's Being Updated

- Migration from ethers.js to viem for blockchain interactions
- Enhanced wallet management for handling up to 39 wallets
- Implementation of multiple launch strategies
- Addition of transaction coordination and timing mechanisms
- Anti-sniper protections for token launches

### Token Bundling Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Updates

1. **Migrate to viem**

   - Replace ethers.js wallet implementation with viem
   - Update contract interaction methods
   - Adapt authentication flow to use viem for signatures

2. **Enhance Wallet Management**
   - Create a wallet coordinator service
   - Implement batch wallet operations
   - Add support for larger number of wallets (up to 39)
   - Improve private key management and security

#### Phase 2: Launch Strategy Implementation

1. **Bundle Launch Strategy**

   - Create token and execute all buys in rapid succession
   - Implement transaction batching for efficiency
   - Add monitoring for confirmation of each transaction

2. **Staggered Launch Strategy**

   - Token creation with immediate dev wallet buy
   - Followed by precisely timed purchases from other wallets
   - Configurable delays between transactions

3. **Anti-Sniper Strategy**
   - Implement monitoring for token contract creation
   - Add detection of external buys (snipers)
   - Create countermeasures for sniper protection

#### Phase 3: Transaction Coordination

1. **Transaction Sequencing**

   - Precise ordering of transactions
   - Optimal gas pricing for quick execution
   - Failure detection and recovery

2. **Timing Mechanisms**
   - Configurable delays between transactions
   - Block-based timing for transaction submission
   - Network congestion detection and adaptation

#### Phase 4: Monitoring and Analytics

1. **Launch Performance Tracking**

   - Monitor transaction success rates
   - Track timing between token creation and purchases
   - Measure effectiveness of anti-sniper strategies

2. **Transaction Validation**
   - Verify successful token purchases
   - Track token distribution across wallets
   - Monitor for unexpected behaviors

### Current Focus

- Migrating blockchain services to use viem
- Implementing the wallet coordinator service
- Creating the launch strategy modules
- Setting up transaction coordination capabilities

### What's Left to Build

1. **Enhanced Features**

   - Multiple launch strategies
   - Transaction timing and coordination
   - Wallet orchestration service
   - Anti-sniper protection mechanisms

2. **Robustness Improvements**

   - Better error handling with strategy-specific recovery
   - Transaction monitoring and confirmation
   - Gas optimization for different network conditions
   - Advanced failure recovery mechanisms

3. **User Experience**
   - Strategy selection interface
   - Launch performance reporting
   - Transaction status monitoring
   - Configuration management for launch strategies

## Known Issues

- Need to migrate from ethers.js to viem
- Contract deployment monitoring needs improvement
- Transaction coordination needs implementation
- Multi-wallet management needs enhancement

## Next Priority

1. Complete migration to viem
2. Implement wallet coordinator service
3. Create launch strategy modules
4. Add transaction timing capabilities
