# Four Meme CLI - Progress

## Project Status: Token Bundling Implementation Phase

### What Works

- Project structure set up with TypeScript
- CLI command framework implemented with Commander
- Authentication flow created using SIWE
- Token creation API integration implemented
- Basic blockchain interaction for token creation and purchasing
- Interactive CLI interface with prompts for missing parameters
- Development mode for testing without real private keys
- Wallet coordinator service using viem
- Launch strategy interfaces and implementations
- Strategy factory for creating different launch strategies
- CLI updated to support different launch strategies

### What's Being Updated

- Migration from ethers.js to viem for blockchain interactions
- Enhanced wallet management for handling up to 39 wallets
- Implementation of multiple launch strategies
- Addition of transaction coordination and timing mechanisms
- Anti-sniper protections for token launches

- ✅ Added batch operations functionality

#### Phase 2: Launch Strategy Implementation

- ✅ Defined strategy types and interfaces
- ✅ Implemented BundleLaunchStrategy
- ✅ Implemented StaggeredLaunchStrategy
- ✅ Implemented AntiSniperStrategy
- ✅ Created StrategyFactoryService

#### Phase 3: Transaction Coordination

- ✅ Implemented transaction sequencing in WalletCoordinatorService
- ✅ Added timing mechanisms for transaction execution
- ✅ Implemented gas price optimization
- ✅ Added confirmation tracking

#### Phase 4: CLI Interface Updates

- ✅ Added strategy selection options to CLI

### Current Focus

- Testing the complete token bundling implementation
- Finalizing the integration between components
- Refining error handling and recovery mechanisms

### What's Left to Build

1. **Enhanced Features**

   - Improved contract monitoring for deployment confirmation
   - Advanced anti-sniper countermeasures
   - Token distribution capabilities
   - Advanced error recovery mechanisms

2. **Robustness Improvements**

   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Transaction retry mechanisms
   - Network congestion detection
   - Gas price adaptation based on network conditions

3. **Documentation & Testing**
   - User documentation for different strategies
   - Example configurations
   - Testing with real tokens on testnet
   - Performance testing with multiple wallets

## Known Issues

- Need to implement contract monitoring functionality for token deployment confirmation
- Error handling for transaction failures could be improved
- Strategy implementations need more robust error handling

## Next Priority

1. Test the token bundling implementation with real credentials on testnet
2. Refine error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Improve transaction monitoring
4. Create user documentation for different strategies
