### What's Been Updated

- Migration from ethers.js to viem for blockchain interactions
- Enhanced wallet management for handling up to 39 wallets
- Implementation of multiple launch strategies
- Addition of transaction coordination and timing mechanisms
- Anti-sniper protections for token launches
- Fixed engine service tests and strategy tests
- Removed all ts-ignore comments and improved type safety
- Added proper mock objects for testing strategies
- Enhanced error handling in tests

### Current Focus

- Testing the complete token bundling implementation with real credentials
- Refining error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Continuing to maintain high code quality and test coverage

### What's Left to Build

1. **Enhanced Features**

   - Improved contract monitoring for deployment confirmation
   - Advanced anti-sniper countermeasures
   - Token distribution capabilities
   - Advanced error recovery mechanisms

2. **Robustness Improvements**

   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Transaction retry mechanisms
   - Network congestion detection
   - Gas price adaptation based on network conditions

3. **Documentation & Testing**
   - User documentation for different strategies
   - Example configurations
   - Testing with real tokens on testnet
   - Performance testing with multiple wallets

## Known Issues

- Need to implement contract monitoring functionality for token deployment confirmation
- Error handling for transaction failures could be improved
- Strategy implementations need more robust error handling

## Next Priority

1. Test the token bundling implementation with real credentials on testnet
2. Refine error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Improve transaction monitoring
4. Create user documentation for different strategies
