# Four Meme CLI - Progress

## Project Status: Planning Phase

### What Works

- None of the implementation has begun yet
- Reference code for API interactions has been analyzed

### Key Milestones

### Current Tasks in Progress

- Setting up project documentation
- Analyzing API flow from reference code
- Planning system architecture

### Completed Tasks

- Initial analysis of the reference implementation
- Setup of memory bank documentation

### What's Left to Build

1. **Core Infrastructure**

   - Project structure
   - Development environment
   - Configuration management

2. **Authentication Flow**

   - SIWE implementation
   - API token management
   - Session handling

3. **Image Handling**

   - File selection interface
   - Image validation and processing
   - Upload functionality

4. **Token Creation**

   - Parameter collection interface
   - API integration
   - Validation rules

5. **Smart Contract Interaction**

   - Contract deployment integration
   - Transaction signing
   - Deployment monitoring

6. **Purchase Strategy**

   - Multi-wallet management
   - Transaction scheduling
   - Purchase confirmation

7. **User Interface**

   - Command structure
   - Interactive prompts
   - Progress indicators

8. **Documentation & Testing**
   - User documentation
   - Integration tests
   - Error handling validation

## Known Issues

- No implementation issues yet as development hasn't started

## Next Priority

1. Set up the basic project structure with TypeScript
2. Implement the authentication module as the first functional component
3. Create a simple CLI interface for parameter input
