# Four Meme CLI - Active Context

## Current Focus

We are at the initial implementation stage of the Four Meme CLI project. We have set up the project structure and implemented the core components for token creation and purchasing.

## Recent Changes

- Created the basic project structure with TypeScript
- Implemented API services for authentication and token creation
- Set up blockchain services for wallet management and contract interaction
- Created CLI command structure for token creation
- Implemented engine service to orchestrate the process

## Current Status

- Project structure is established
- Basic CLI command interface is working
- Core components are implemented but need testing with real credentials

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

1. **CLI Framework**: Selected Commander for command-line parsing with Figlet for UI banners
2. **Image Handling**: Will use Sharp for image processing when needed
3. **Authentication Flow**: Implemented SIWE (Sign-in with Ethereum) using ethers.js signatures
4. **Development Mode**: Added development mode for testing without real private keys

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Testing with Real Credentials**: First priority to verify the API integration
2. **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance robustness and user feedback
3. **Contract Monitoring**: Implement better contract deployment monitoring
4. **Purchase Strategies**: Fine-tune the purchase timing and wallet coordination

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Test the CLI with real credentials
2. Implement better error handling with retries
3. Add logging for troubleshooting
4. Implement contract monitoring for token deployment

### Short-term Goals

1. Complete testing with real token creation
2. Add support for configuration files
3. Improve the UI with better progress indicators
4. Add support for image compression

### Medium-term Goals

1. Implement more advanced purchase strategies
2. Add support for token liquidity management
3. Create a command for token sniping

## Open Questions

1. What is the best way to monitor for successful token contract deployment?
2. What are the optimal gas settings for quick token purchases post-deployment?
3. How to coordinate multiple wallet purchases most effectively?
4. What are the best strategies to avoid failed transactions?
