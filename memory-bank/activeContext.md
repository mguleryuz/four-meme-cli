# Four Meme CLI - Active Context

## Current Focus

We have implemented the core token bundling capabilities in the Four Meme CLI project. Our focus now is on testing and refining the implementation to ensure it works effectively for creating tokens on four.meme while protecting creators from snipers and front-running.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented wallet coordinator service using viem
- Created strategy interfaces and implementations for different launch patterns
- Implemented bundle, staggered, and anti-sniper strategies
- Created strategy factory service for managing strategies
- Updated CLI to support strategy selection and configuration
- Implemented transaction coordination and timing mechanisms

## Current Status

- Core token bundling architecture implemented
- Multiple launch strategies implemented
- CLI updated to support different strategies
- Implementation needs testing with real credentials

## Active Decisions

### Token Bundling Implementation

1. **Core Components**:

   - **Wallet Coordinator**: Created using viem for managing up to 39 wallets
   - **Launch Strategies**: Implemented bundle, staggered, and anti-sniper approaches
   - **Transaction Coordination**: Added timing and sequencing capabilities
   - **CLI Integration**: Updated to support strategy selection and configuration

2. **Strategy Patterns**:

   - **Bundle Launch**: Creates token and executes all buys in rapid succession
   - **Staggered Launch**: Creates token with immediate dev wallet buy, followed by timed purchases
   - **Anti-Sniper**: Monitors for sniper activity and implements countermeasures

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Used viem for all blockchain interactions
   - Implemented transaction batching and sequencing
   - Added gas price optimization
   - Created strategy-specific configuration options

### Architecture Design

The updated architecture follows a strategy pattern, with these key components:

1. **WalletCoordinatorService**: Central service for managing wallets and coordinating transactions
2. **StrategyFactoryService**: Factory for creating and initializing different launch strategies
3. **Launch Strategies**: Concrete implementations of different token launch approaches
4. **CLI Integration**: Enhanced CLI with strategy selection and configuration options

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Testing**: Test the implementation with real credentials on testnet
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. **Documentation**: Create user documentation for different strategies
4. **Refinement**: Refine the implementation based on testing feedback

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Test the token bundling implementation with real credentials on testnet
2. Implement more robust error handling for transaction failures
3. Improve monitoring for token contract deployment confirmation
4. Add more detailed transaction status reporting

### Short-term Goals

1. Refine the implementation based on testing feedback
2. Create comprehensive documentation for different strategies
3. Implement advanced anti-sniper countermeasures
4. Add token distribution capabilities

### Medium-term Goals

1. Explore smart contract implementation for bundled transactions
2. Implement advanced monitoring and analytics
3. Add network congestion detection and adaptation
4. Create configuration profiles for different launch scenarios

## Open Questions

1. What are the most effective anti-sniper countermeasures for four.meme tokens?
2. How can we optimize gas prices for different network conditions?
3. What is the optimal wallet count for different strategies?
4. How can we most effectively monitor for successful token contract deployment?
5. What additional features would be most valuable for token creators?
