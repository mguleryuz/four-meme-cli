# Four Meme CLI - Active Context

## Current Focus

We have fully implemented the core token bundling capabilities in the Four Meme CLI project. Our focus now is on fixing the remaining test failures and ensuring the codebase is robust for real money transactions. The placeholder implementations have been replaced with actual working code to handle real money transactions.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented full BundleLaunchStrategy with real transaction handling
- Implemented full StaggeredLaunchStrategy with real transaction handling
- Added proper waitForTokenAddress method to poll for token contract deployment
- Added getTokenDetails method to TokenService for fetching token information
- Updated ITokenOptions interface to include necessary properties
- Improved error handling in strategy execution
- Fixed type issues in EngineService for strategy initialization
- Added proper transaction confirmation checks

## Current Status

- Core token bundling architecture fully implemented
- Multiple launch strategies implemented with real transaction handling
- API integration complete with token details polling
- Some tests are failing and need to be fixed:
  - BundleLaunchStrategy execution test
  - StaggeredLaunchStrategy execution test
  - Engine failure handling test
- Implementation ready for testing with real credentials after test fixes

## Active Decisions

### Test Fixes Needed

1. **Strategy Execution Tests**:

   - Need to properly mock the wallet coordinator in strategy tests
   - Tests are failing with "No clients available for confirmation check"
   - Need to enhance the test setup for wallet coordinator

2. **Engine Error Handling**:
   - Current implementation swallows errors in strategy execution
   - Engine service needs to be updated to properly propagate errors or handle them appropriately

### Token Bundling Implementation

1. **Core Components**:

   - **Wallet Coordinator**: Using viem for managing wallets with proper transaction handling
   - **Launch Strategies**: Bundle and Staggered strategies now fully implemented
   - **Token Creation Flow**: Complete API and blockchain integration
   - **Transaction Coordination**: Added proper timing, confirmation, and gas optimization

2. **Strategy Implementations**:

   - **Bundle Launch**: Creates token and executes all purchases in rapid succession with proper transaction confirmation
   - **Staggered Launch**: Creates token with primary wallet, then executes timed purchases with other wallets
   - **Transaction Management**: Added proper error handling, gas optimization, and confirmation checks

3. **API Integration**:
   - Added getTokenDetails method to TokenService
   - Implemented proper polling for token contract address
   - Enhanced error handling for API interactions

### Architecture Enhancements

The architecture has been significantly enhanced:

1. **Token Creation Flow**:

   - Image upload
   - Token metadata creation
   - Contract deployment monitoring
   - Address resolution

2. **Transaction Handling**:

   - Proper gas estimation
   - Transaction confirmation
   - Error recovery
   - Sequential and batch execution

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced error reporting
   - Transaction failure recovery
   - API error handling

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Test Fixes**: Fix the failing tests to ensure all functionality works as expected
2. **Real Money Testing**: Test the implementation with small amounts on mainnet
3. **Error Recovery**: Enhance error recovery mechanisms for failed transactions
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for using different strategies

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Fix the failing tests for BundleLaunchStrategy and StaggeredLaunchStrategy
2. Fix the engine error handling test
3. Add more robust wallet coordinator mocking in tests
4. Test with small amounts of real money on mainnet

### Short-term Goals

1. Implement proper error recovery for failed transactions
2. Add transaction monitoring with detailed status updates
3. Create user documentation for different strategies
4. Add configuration profiles for different scenarios

### Medium-term Goals

1. Optimize gas pricing for different network conditions
2. Enhance anti-sniper countermeasures
3. Add more advanced token distribution options
4. Implement transaction batching for gas optimization

## Open Questions

1. What is the optimal approach for mocking the wallet coordinator in tests?
2. How should we handle transaction failures in different strategies?
3. What additional sanity checks should be implemented before real money transactions?
4. How can we improve transaction confirmation monitoring?
5. What are the optimal gas price strategies for different network conditions?
